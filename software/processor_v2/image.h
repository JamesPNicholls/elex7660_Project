/*  Originally used a brute force method of sending information to
    the memory buffer. This was impractical for memory reasons. Drawing
    is accomplished by drawing a series of rectanles using DRAW_RECTABLE(0x22) 
    comamnd via the alt_avalon_spi_command().

    Each group of 4 is a start and stop coordinate of a rectangle on the image 
    See file /python/image_convert.py for demonstration of how coordinates were
    determined.
